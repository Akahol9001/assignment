                <p><b>Sam Manekshaw</b>  full name Sam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw, was a prominent Indian military leader, most notably known for his role as the Chief of the Army Staff of the Indian Army during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. He was born on April 3, 1914, and passed away on June 27, 2008.

Manekshaw played a crucial role in India's victory in the 1971 war, which led to the creation of Bangladesh. His strategic planning and leadership were instrumental in the swift and decisive victory of the Indian forces over Pakistan. His famous directive to the Pakistani forces in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), "You surrender or we wipe you out," became a symbol of his determination and resolve.
